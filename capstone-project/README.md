# Capstone Project

## Project Requirements:

### Overview

Groups must demonstrate:

- Ability to collaborate with others and build functional code together
- Ability to create and use a database
- Ability to create and use a server
- Ability to create and use a UI (user interface)
- Ability to create an app that interacts with the UI, server and database
- Ability to deploy a project online

### Specifics

The project must meet the following criteria:

- App solves a specific problem with technology.
- App is deployed and accessible on the web.
- App successfully builds and runs without issue.
- Uncontrollable errors are handled gracefully and visually explained to the user.
- Code is hosted on GitHub with all group membersâ€™ clear and frequent commit history.
- Code follows best practices such as using good variable names, proper indentation, and following the D.R.Y. principle.
- The App is responsive and functional on small and large screen sizes.
- The App contains 2+ resources along with related tables.
- The App uses at least one one-to-many relationship.
- The App contains full CRUD routes.
    - Overall, not necessarily per resource.
- The App includes a thoughtful file structure on both the back-end and front-end.
- Code follows a consistent and professional format, such as using consistent spacing and naming conventions appropriate for the chosen language.
- All members must contribute to the code base in a significant way.

### Expectation

Use the technical stack you have learned. You may add additional libraries/APIs etc. Even if your app is designed to go to the App store, the apps on the app store all still have: A UI (user interface: something the user interacts with), a server and a database. Therefore, building a web app can still adequately demonstrate the core of your idea. If you would want to create a version for another device, you can work on that after demo day.
